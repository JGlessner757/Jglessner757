# TIRES: The Key to Getting Your Analytics Project on the Road

You know that feeling when you’ve built something amazing—a high-powered, shiny Ferrari of a project—but something just isn’t clicking? It’s all horsepower and potential, but it’s going nowhere. The problem? You’ve got no tires. All that power, and you’re stuck in place, spinning your wheels and creating nothing but smoke and frustration.

The same thing happens when advanced analytics, machine learning, or AI projects don't get properly operationalized. It’s not that the tech isn’t good—it’s incredible. But without the right plan in place, it won’t gain any traction. That's where TIRES come in.

**TIRES** is my acronym for the five components you need to get that powerful engine actually moving:

- **Training**
- **Integration**
- **Reinforcement**
- **Evaluation**
- **Support**

These are the ‘tires’ that let your project grip the road and drive real results. Let’s break it down:

## Training
If people don’t know how to use the new tool, it’s like handing them the keys to that Ferrari but never teaching them to drive. Solid, clear, and practical training is the first step to making sure your project doesn’t just sit in the garage gathering dust.

## Integration
Your Ferrari needs to fit in with the rest of your workflow. If using the new tool feels like an extra hurdle or doesn’t mesh with the way people work, it’s going to be left in the lot. Integration means making sure your shiny new toy fits seamlessly into the day-to-day grind.

## Reinforcement
Here’s the thing: people forget stuff. Even after great training, if you’re not reinforcing the lessons, old habits creep back in. You’ve got to keep reinforcing the new ways, or your tool will end up underused or ignored. 

## Evaluation
You wouldn’t drive a car without checking the tires every once in a while, right? Same goes here. Is your tool being used the way it should? Is it working as expected? Gathering feedback and making tweaks along the way is critical to keeping things running smoothly.

## Support
Even the best tools need a pit crew. When users hit a bump in the road, they need to know where to turn for help—and fast. If you’ve got solid, accessible support, people are much more likely to stick with the new way of doing things.

Without TIRES—**Training, Integration, Reinforcement, Evaluation, and Support**—your advanced analytics project is like a Ferrari with no tires: all power, no progress. But with TIRES, you can operationalize your tools, get the wheels turning, and drive real results.
